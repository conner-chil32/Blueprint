This page explains all capacities of the Docker and its usage within the Blueprint project.
## What is Docker?

"Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly" -[dockerdocs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-overview/)

Docker is an extremely useful tool for any application that requires scalability and also require a uniform structure that can be used across multiple operating systems. One of the biggest problems that docker solves is the issue of:

*It works on my PC*

This is because Docker functions on the concept of *Containerization*.



Docker is not foul-proof, as it has some *unique* peculiarities, especially on Windows, but overall Docker is an indispensable tool that is extremely common in any modern tech stack.

## Why do we need Docker?

Short answer: *Simplicity*

Docker removes the burden of hosting the application off of the user or hosting service, and allows the developer to perfectly craft the exact operating system to run the given application. Because of this flexibility, Docker is the standard for any cloud hosting service provider as they can have servers running one operating system, while the application itself can be running on a completely different one.
