/**
 * Spot file for containing universal variables.
 * 
 * These variables could be publicly available, anything that could compromise
 * privacy or security should not be in here.
 * 
 * INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING VARIABLES:
 * Add the variables, labeled, alongside the others in an organized fashion.
 * Only universal variables, and they must not be changed during runtime.
 * 
 * How to declare the variables correctly:
 * export const exampleString = 'Success!';
 * 
 * Then, in the JavaScript file you want to use them in:
 * const spotVars = require('./SpotBack.js');
 * You can then access the variables with spotVars.exampleString
 * 
 * This is for back end variables only, and they must be unchanging.
